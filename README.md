### Hey there,

It’s David, in a few sentences about my work. On January 11, 2019, I created the Uigitdev page on Instagram in order to publish my development journey. From time to time, I create open source projects on GitHub as well as Flutter projects on the Patreon site. I started my career as an Android developer, but I’ve been using Flutter to develop apps in recent months. In the next period, I will continue in the direction of Flutter.
